We both had mutual friends, HM and HJ, and whenever they weren't in the picture, Young and I got closer and closer.

I wanna get to know him more..(smirk)'",

And without a car, it really seemed like even more distant for me. With work being so busy, Young and I only met up once every 1-2 months. Each little weekend or holiday that we'd get to spend together was pure happiness. I think we took the most pictures then",
