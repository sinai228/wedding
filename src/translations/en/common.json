    "s1": "When I first saw him in the dorm parking lot, I thought that he had pretty eyes. My ideal man has always been one with pretty eyes and a pretty smile, little did i know that he'd become my man.",
    "h2": "",
    "s2": "For the first two months, we saw each other almost every day to study. and all we did was study. We both had mutual friends, HM and HJ, and for some reason whenever they weren't in the picture, Young and I got closer and closer. Young often made excuses to come visit the dorm apartment I shared with HV and SK. We all sat down to watch movies, play cards, and talk often. (little did I know it was all a part of his master plan).",
    "h3": "",
    "s3": "I remember that it was around early November that we first sat down together, alone, for the first time and we talked for 6 hours straight. At the end of the conversation, I thought, 'Ooo. I wanna get to know him more..(smirk)'",
    "h4": "",
    "s4": "On my last day of school, all my friends were either gone to visit family or to work, and I was pretty much left alone. Young texted and asked if he could come over to hang out. And I said sure, why not. What on earth could happen when a girl and a guy are alone together? Well, we had our deep talk that night. He asked the question, what am i to you? I answered well, you're one of the closest oppa I have. And I already in my heart that he was THE closest oppa I had. I asked him the same question, and he replied, he wants to be my best friend. I knew then and there that he and I did have mutual feelings for each other.",
    "h5": "",
    "s5": "The week before and after Christmas went by in a swoosh. The week before was full of butterfly-in-the-stomach moments with Young. He asked me out when we were playfully talking on the couch. I didn't quite expect this to happen, since we both knew that we were probably not going to be around each other long-term. I was a bit hesistant to start anything, when I knew nothing was planned out ahead of me. I didn't want to risk losing a close person who I cared about. He told me he'd wait. On Christmas day, hanvit and I came down sick with COVID. Young decided to stay in the house to take care of us, and not surprisingly, he came down with much worse COVID symptoms. We didn't see each other for days when he was sick but he kept lingering in my mind after all the time we had spend the week before. One day when he offered another, 'when are you gonna be ready?', I told him, 'Starting now!'",
    "h6": "",
    "s6": "We both had our graduation coming up, job searching, and an unknown future. I was hesitant to start a new relation in the midst of all unknowns. But I think it was him who gave me the certainty that I could get a job, carry on the relationship that I had with him. We were both there next to each other to celebrate when getting our first job offer, our final walk around campus, submitting our final test in college.",
    "h7": "",
    "s7": "Young was the first one to leave. I stayed in GR, working, and he left to work in Detroit mid-summer. The 3 minute distance in between us drastically changed to a 3 hour drive. And without a car, it really seemed like even more distant for me. With work being so busy, Young and I only met up once every 1-2 months. Each little weekend or holiday that we'd get to spend together was pure happiness. I think we took the most pictures then",
    "h8": "",
    "s8": "adjusting to the new bland life without him was another change. I purposely made myself so busy, traveling, working out, and meeting friends. ",
    "h9": "",
    "s9": "In the last few months of 2022, I decided to make a move. For all four years in college, I couldn't wait to get out, yet I was keeping myself cozy and comfy in the safe little bubble I created for myself at a familiar place with familiar people.",
    "h10": "",
    "s10": "My brother and my friend got married, creating a home here in the US for both of us. It was then when we both realized the importance of having family and sharing the love to other people. ",
    "h11": "",
    "s11": "45 minutes was just enought to meet on the weekends, but never close enough to do an impromptu date night. Especially on nights with work and other priorities. I think we went to every single date possible. picnics at parks, archery, cafes, beaches, bookstores, car trunks, walking and strolling. When rain came pouring down, or when the snowstorm hit, our planned dates were cancelled too.  ",
    "h12": "",
    "s12": "After work, we met up to get dinner together. I was pretty grumpy that night, but he had a very cute surprise in him room. He had a cute wall of our photos together and a seat surrounded by petals and candles. The next day, he and our friends planned a surprise and all of HV, ER, ZP, YJ came to celebrate '(muah').",
    "h13": "",
    "s13": "I recognize that marriage life won't be always like our first date, but it does provide us a change and a challenge to be in the competition of who can be more of a service. We're in this together for life, and I hope that you'll stay with us to see our journey as we grow and bloom."
