    "h1": "She felt so genuine and bright, like a clear stream in a tough world. Her smile was so real, it made me smile too. Being around her was like finding calm in the countryside.",
    "s1": "When I first saw him in the dorm parking lot, I thought that he had pretty eyes. My ideal man has always been one with pretty eyes and a pretty smile, little did i know that he'd become my man.",
    "h2": "We still argue to this day, but I swear I saw her in the parking lot before school started, dressed in jeans and a sleeveless top. I remember her with her long hair and she just drew my eyes.",
    "s2": "For the first two months, we saw each other almost every day to study. and all we did was study. We both had mutual friends, HM and HJ, and for some reason whenever they weren't in the picture, Young and I got closer and closer. Young often made excuses to come visit the dorm apartment I shared with HV and SK. We all sat down to watch movies, play cards, and talk often. (little did I know it was all a part of his master plan).",
    "h3": "For the longest time, I maintained the ice-cold personality. Even though I saw her every day in the study room. It was as if we'd known each other forever. It was so comfortable and fun talking to her. I sensed that we did feel a bit closer which made me feel like I'd gotten a step closer to my goal.",
    "s3": "I remember that it was around early November that we first sat down together, alone, for the first time and we talked for 6 hours straight. At the end of the conversation, I thought, 'Ooo. I wanna get to know him more..(smirk)'",
    "h4": "After becoming comfortable with each other, we naturally spent more time together, feeling closer and more at ease. Meeting up with her in town became the highlight of our final year of school. I found myself conveying my feelings through small gestures, and when she didn't join our study group, the days felt long and dull. It felt like my feelings were gradually growing stronger. I can't remember exactly when it started, but there were moments when I felt she meant a lot to me. Especially when she was going through a tough time, it made me realize we had crossed a threshold. That's when my pursuit began, and I started pursuing her relentlessly. If I had approached my studies with the same determination, I might have won a Nobel Prize by now...",
    "s4": "On my last day of school, all my friends were either gone to visit family or to work, and I was pretty much left alone. Young texted and asked if he could come over to hang out. And I said sure, why not. What on earth could happen when a girl and a guy are alone together? Well, we had our deep talk that night. He asked the question, what am i to you? I answered well, you're one of the closest oppa I have. And I already in my heart that he was THE closest oppa I had. I asked him the same question, and he replied, he wants to be my best friend. I knew then and there that he and I did have mutual feelings for each other.",
    "h5": "Finally, after all the evaluations, I received the OK sign from her, cornered by persistent pursuit. From January 5th, I officially upgraded to being a confident boyfriend where we could hold hands openly without a care in the world. The emotions and excitement at that moment were beyond words. It was so touching to hear those words at the same place where it all began, at the KE study room.",
    "s5": "The week before and after Christmas went by in a swoosh. The week before was full of butterfly-in-the-stomach moments with Young. He asked me out when we were playfully talking on the couch. I didn't quite expect this to happen, since we both knew that we were probably not going to be around each other long-term. I was a bit hesistant to start anything, when I knew nothing was planned out ahead of me. I didn't want to risk losing a close person who I cared about. He told me he'd wait. On Christmas day, hanvit and I came down sick with COVID. Young decided to stay in the house to take care of us, and not surprisingly, he came down with much worse COVID symptoms. We didn't see each other for days when he was sick but he kept lingering in my mind after all the time we had spend the week before. One day when he offered another, 'when are you gonna be ready?', I told him, 'Starting now!'",
    "h6": "I never really thought graduation was a big deal. After the long hard years of college, I was feeling rather sick of and so done that I had already made up my mind not to attend the graduation ceremony. But with Sinai's encouragement, I had the chance to put a nice end to it all with a ribbon on top. ",
    "s6": "We both had our graduation coming up, job searching, and an unknown future. I was hesitant to start a new relation in the midst of all unknowns. But I think it was him who gave me the certainty that I could get a job, carry on the relationship that I had with him. We were both there next to each other to celebrate when getting our first job offer, our final walk around campus, submitting our final test in college",
    "h7": "After graduation I stayed one more semester in campus to finish a summer class and she started her first remote gig, following her cs degree. From the hint of spring to the utter heat of summer, I was so glad to have spent time with her beside me. We explored the little neighborhoods and alleys in the same city we'd been for the last four years. Each and every moment was so full of warmth. I incredibly enjoyed the gradual process of getting to know and understand Sinai on a deeper level. ",
    "s7": "Young was the first one to leave. I stayed in GR, working, and he left to work in Detroit mid-summer. The 3 minute distance in between us drastically changed to a 3 hour drive. And without a car, it really seemed like even more distant for me. With work being so busy, Young and I only met up once every 1-2 months. Each little weekend or holiday that we'd get to spend together was pure happiness. I think we took the most pictures then",
    "h8": "Leaving the pleasant memories behind, I had to relocate to Detroit for my first job. Even with no time difference, we barely had time to call. Even if we did, it would be around closer to midnight. Every holiday, I drove over to see her, which wasn't too often. And every time we did, we could only see so far ahead till our next goodbye. I still remember so clearly Sinai holding back her tears as she said her last goodbye before I left for Detroit.  ",
    "s8": "Adjusting to the new bland life without him was another change. I purposely made myself so busy, traveling, working out, and meeting friends. ",
    "h9": "We saw some positive changes after a period of LDR. I left my chaotic first job for a new one with a bit more work-life balance, and Sinai decided to leave Grand Rapids and move to Ann Arbor, just 30 minutes away from me. Thanks to her decision to leave behind our beloved hometown and friends, we could see each other more often on weekends. Our rollercoaster relationship finally settled into a peaceful parallel, and peace found its way into my heart. Of course, the longing when we parted on weekends remained, but looking back, I'm grateful for those times when we could still meet next week and the week after.  ",
    "s9": "In the last few months of 2022, I decided to make a move. For all four years in college, I couldn't wait to get out, yet I was keeping myself cozy and comfy in the safe little bubble I created for myself at a familiar place with familiar people. Now that I look back on it, perhaps the move to Ann Arbor was a step taken unknowingly toward this marriage.",
    "h10": "An important turning point occurred when Zion, her close brother, got engaged and married. This event prompted me to reconsider my views on marriage. Witnessing Zion's engagement, despite his young age, made me realize that I had been too vague and hesitant about the idea. It shifted my focus away from excuses and towards prioritizing our relationship",
    "s10": "My brother and my friend got married, creating a home here in the US for both of us. It was then when we both realized the importance of having family and sharing the love to other people. ",
    "h11": "After she moved to Detroit, we started exploring various restaurants in the city every weekend, creating countless happy memories. Our weekends became precious as they offered us the opportunity to share our thoughts and concerns openly, something we couldn't easily do with others. However, on weekdays, our distance made it difficult to meet, so we relied on phone calls to check in and chat. We often found ourselves wishing for more time together during our weekend dates, hoping for a space where we could spend more time when it was time to part ways.",
    "s11": "45 minutes was just enough to meet on the weekends, but never close enough to do an impromptu date night. Especially on nights with work and other priorities. I think we went to every single date possible. picnics at parks, archery, cafes, beaches, bookstores, car trunks, walking and strolling. When rain came pouring down, or when the snowstorm hit, our planned dates were cancelled too.  ",
    "h12": "Weekend dates and seeing happy married couples around us made marriage seem less daunting. We realized that being together, no matter what marriage brings, was the big plus. So, I decided to show her my true feelings by proposing with a ring and a plan. She already had a glimpse of what was going to happen, but she accepted my proposal on January 19th, marking a new beginning for us!",
    "s12": "After work, we met up to get dinner together. I was pretty grumpy that night, but he had a very cute surprise in him room. He had a cute wall of our photos together and a seat surrounded by petals and candles. The next day, he and our friends planned a surprise and all of HV, ER, ZP, YJ came to celebrate '(muah').",
    "h13": "Thanks for always cherishing me with unwavering love and tender looks, Sinai. Being with you gives me the courage to do anything. I'm so excited for our next chapter and whatever stories we create together. Let's keep holding hands, laughing, crying, and making more wonderful memories together! I'm counting on you for a lifetime.",
    "s13": "Thank you so much, Yeongrak. I appreciate you always being by my side like a sturdy tree. You love me even when I'm happy, upset, or grumpy, and for that, I'm grateful. Let's keep it that way ((=^▽^)σ) In this adventure where our black hair turns gray, there might be disagreements, but let's laugh and enjoy life together. Let's grow and bloom together."
